# PopUpBox
Create a web project that includes a pop-up box triggered by a button click using JavaScript. The pop-up box should dynamically appear, providing additional information, forms, or interactive content. Employ HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for handling the button click event and managing the pop-upâ€™s visibility and content.
